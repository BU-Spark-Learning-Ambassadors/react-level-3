## Requirements Confirmation

Please make sure that you have completed the requirements of the project.

- [ ] **Visualize Data:** fetches data from an API ([free ones here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file#index)) and renders the results in a table with paging.
- [ ] **Leverages React Hooks:** uses `useState()` and `useEffect()` to manage variable changes and accessing API
- [ ] **Git Best Practices:** hides all API Keys and secrets in a `.env` file and uses a `.gitignore` to prevent all unneccessary files from being added to the GitHub Repository. Also does not push `node_modules` as it is very large.

 **CHOOSE ONE**
- [ ] **Store Users in Database:** Have a form that allows users to enter their emails to join your mailing list. Display this mailing list in a table.
